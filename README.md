# A C++ pyson implementation
An implementation of the pyson file type
(see https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON for the original implementation)
<br>
## Why use pyson?
Don't. It is a horrible file type. That said, if you need a reasonably compact way to store
integer, floating point, string, or string list values, you could technically do worse
(it could be JSON).
<br>
## Why this implementation?
Because it works and is definitely faster than the original Python implementation.
And also has a way better and more idiomatic API. And a README that agrees with the code.
Maybe I'll even make a way to turn pyson into JSON or TOML or Pkl at some point, who knows.
<br>
## How do I install it?
~~You don't.~~ <br>
I have no idea whether it will work on literally any platform, so just do whatever you would with
any other C++ library you need to install from source (no idea how people normally do that).
<br>
## Where is the documentation?
What documentation?
